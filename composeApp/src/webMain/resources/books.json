        "title": "The Little Rascal",
        "content": "In the martial world, there was a small sect called the 'Green Bamboo Gang,' with no more than thirty disciples, barely worth mentioning in the broader martial arts community. Yet it was this small sect that produced a little rascal who gave the entire martial world a headache -- Wang Qiwu.\n\nWang Qiwu was eighteen this year, the only son of the Green Bamboo Gang's leader, Old Man Wang. This kid had been trouble since childhood -- stealing chickens, pilfering dogs, getting into fights -- he was skilled at all of it. On top of that, his martial arts were actually quite good, and he had few rivals among his peers. Though the Green Bamboo Gang was small, Old Man Wang had been a notable figure in the martial world in his younger days. It was only after growing weary of the constant strife that he brought a few sworn brothers to settle at the foot of this remote mountain and founded the Green Bamboo Gang.\n\nHaving grown up in the Green Bamboo Gang, Wang Qiwu had naturally developed a solid martial arts foundation through constant exposure. But he was mischievous by nature and refused to train properly, spending his days scheming about how to make a name for himself in the martial world. Though Old Man Wang had disciplined him many times, Wang Qiwu always paid lip service to obedience while doing whatever he pleased behind his father's back.\n\nOn this day, Wang Qiwu once again led a few of his little brothers into town to 'uphold justice.' Of course, 'upholding justice' really meant collecting protection money. The small merchants in town saw Wang Qiwu coming and hurried to shut their doors. Wang Qiwu swaggered down the street, trailed by his little lackeys, each one wearing an insufferably arrogant expression.\n\n'Brother Qiwu, it's time to collect this month's protection money,' one lackey reminded him.\n\n'I know,' Wang Qiwu nodded. 'Same as always, start from East Street.'\n\nThey arrived at a tofu vendor's stall. The vendor was an honest old man. Seeing Wang Qiwu approach, the old man hurriedly pulled out ten copper coins and handed them over with trembling hands. 'Brother Qiwu, here's this month's protection money.'\n\nWang Qiwu took the money and patted the old man's shoulder. 'Good, very sensible. If anyone bullies you in the future, just drop my name -- Wang Qiwu.'\n\n'Yes, yes, yes,' the old man nodded repeatedly, silently cursing his bad luck.\n\nAfter making the rounds, Wang Qiwu had collected over fifty copper coins. He said to his brothers smugly, 'See that? This is the martial world. Whoever has the hardest fists calls the shots. Our Green Bamboo Gang may be small, but in this town, we're the boss.'\n\n'Brother Qiwu is mighty!' the lackeys shouted in unison.\n\nJust then, a middle-aged man dressed in black suddenly appeared behind Wang Qiwu, his gaze as cold and sharp as a blade. 'Wang Qiwu of the Green Bamboo Gang? I hear you're quite the fighter?'\n\nWang Qiwu turned around and felt a jolt of alarm. The man in black radiated a powerful killing intent -- clearly no ordinary person. But Wang Qiwu kept up his fearless facade. 'That's me. What of it?'\n\n'Nothing much. I just want to have a little sparring match with you,' the man in black said casually.\n\n'Sure,' Wang Qiwu agreed. Though he felt a twinge of nervousness, he couldn't back down in front of so many people.\n\nThe two squared off, and Wang Qiwu struck first, throwing a punch aimed at the man's face. But the man in black simply raised one hand and caught Wang Qiwu's fist. Wang Qiwu tried to break free but found the man's grip was like an iron vice -- completely inescapable.\n\n'Kid, your martial arts aren't bad, but you've got a long way to go,' the man in black said, then gave a gentle push. Wang Qiwu stumbled back over a dozen steps, nearly falling.\n\nRefusing to accept defeat, Wang Qiwu charged again. But no matter how he attacked, the man in black deflected everything with ease. After more than a dozen exchanges, Wang Qiwu was panting heavily, while the man in black remained perfectly composed.\n\n'Let's leave it here for today,' the man in black said, suddenly withdrawing. 'Kid, your martial arts aren't bad, but you've still got a long way to go. Consider this a lesson -- don't be so arrogant in the future.'\n\nWith that, the man in black turned and walked away, quickly disappearing into the crowd.\n\nWang Qiwu stood rooted to the spot, his emotions in turmoil. This was the first time he had encountered a true master, and the first time he had been so thoroughly humiliated. But rather than feeling discouraged, it only strengthened his resolve to make a name for himself in the martial world.\n\n'Brother Qiwu, are you alright?' the lackeys gathered around him.\n\n'I'm fine,' Wang Qiwu waved them off. 'Let's go, we're heading back. And nobody breathes a word about what happened today.'\n\nBack at the Green Bamboo Gang, Wang Qiwu locked himself in his room and began training seriously. He knew that to gain a foothold in the martial world, cleverness alone wouldn't be enough -- he needed real skill. But what Wang Qiwu didn't know was that a far greater storm was quietly brewing. The appearance of the man in black was only the beginning."

        "title": "The Massacre",
        "content": "Three nights later, on a dark and windy night, the Green Bamboo Gang was suddenly surrounded by a group of men in black. These men were all highly skilled fighters who moved like phantoms, infiltrating the Green Bamboo Gang without making a sound.\n\n'Who's there?' a disciple on night watch spotted the anomaly and shouted. But his voice was quickly replaced by a scream of agony.\n\nDozens of men in black surged into the Green Bamboo Gang like ghosts, killing everyone in sight. Though the disciples of the Green Bamboo Gang fought back with all their might, they were no match for these black-clad assailants. Screams, the sounds of combat, and the clash of weapons filled the air one after another, and the entire Green Bamboo Gang was instantly transformed into a living hell.\n\n'Father!' Wang Qiwu heard the fighting outside and rushed out of his room. The courtyard was already littered with corpses -- all disciples of the Green Bamboo Gang. Old Man Wang was locked in fierce combat with one of the men in black. Though Old Man Wang's martial arts were formidable, he was clearly outmatched.\n\n'Qiwu, run!' Old Man Wang shouted when he saw his son. 'Escape! Carry on the legacy of the Green Bamboo Gang! These people are beyond you!'\n\n'No, I won't leave!' Wang Qiwu's eyes were bloodshot. 'I'll fight alongside you!'\n\n'Foolish child!' Old Man Wang was desperate. 'Staying will only get you killed. Go, carry on the legacy of the Green Bamboo Gang! Remember -- survive, and avenge us!'\n\nAt that moment, one of the men in black attacked Old Man Wang from behind, driving a blade through his chest. Old Man Wang's body shuddered, and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. 'Qiwu... run... remember... avenge us...' Old Man Wang shouted with his last ounce of strength before collapsing to the ground.\n\n'Father!' Wang Qiwu's eyes nearly burst from rage. He wanted to rush over, but several men in black blocked his path. He knew this was not the time for recklessness. He had to survive -- to avenge the Green Bamboo Gang.\n\nWang Qiwu clenched his teeth and turned to run. Several men in black tried to pursue but were stopped by the others. 'Don't bother chasing,' said the one who appeared to be the leader. 'He's just a green kid -- he can't cause any waves. Our mission is complete.'\n\nWang Qiwu ran wildly, not daring to stop until he had covered more than ten miles. He looked back toward the Green Bamboo Gang and saw the sky ablaze with fire -- the entire compound had been reduced to ashes.\n\n'Father... brothers...' Wang Qiwu collapsed to his knees, tears streaming uncontrollably down his face. He had grown up in the Green Bamboo Gang. Though he had been a troublemaker, this place was his home. Now the home was gone, his family was gone -- everything was destroyed.\n\n'Who? Who did this?' Wang Qiwu clenched his fists until his nails dug into his flesh. 'I will find the culprits and avenge you all!'\n\nWang Qiwu hid in the mountains for the night. The next morning at dawn, he crept back to the ruins of the Green Bamboo Gang. Nothing remained -- only scorched earth and a few charred bodies. The air reeked of burning, enough to make one retch.\n\nWang Qiwu searched through the ruins for a long time before finally finding Old Man Wang's belongings -- a rust-spotted short sword. It was the weapon Old Man Wang had used in his youth. Though it hadn't been used in years, Wang Qiwu knew it was the only memento his father had left him.\n\n'Father, rest assured,' Wang Qiwu gripped the short sword, his eyes gleaming with determination. 'I will avenge you and all our brothers! No matter who the enemy is, no matter how powerful they are, I will make them pay for every drop of blood!'\n\nWang Qiwu kowtowed three times before the ruins, then turned and left. He knew that from this day forward, his life would be completely changed. He was no longer the carefree little rascal, but an avenger carrying a blood debt. He had to become stronger, had to find those men in black, had to reclaim justice for the Green Bamboo Gang. But what Wang Qiwu didn't know was that the men in black hadn't let him go. They were searching everywhere for his whereabouts, intending to eliminate him once and for all. A deadly hunt was about to begin."

        "title": "The Path of Vengeance",
        "content": "After leaving the Green Bamboo Gang, Wang Qiwu embarked on his path of vengeance. He inquired everywhere about the men in black, but they seemed to be shrouded in mystery, and few people knew their true identities.\n\n'Have you seen a group of men dressed in black?' Wang Qiwu asked an innkeeper.\n\n'A group of men in black did pass through a few days ago. They headed east,' the innkeeper thought for a moment. 'But young man, I'd advise you not to provoke them. Those people are clearly dangerous -- it would be very risky for you to go after them alone.'\n\n'Thank you for your concern,' Wang Qiwu said, 'but I must find them.'\n\nWang Qiwu traveled east, asking about the men in black at every stop. He passed through countless towns and questioned countless people, but the clues he gathered were scarce. The men in black were like ghosts -- appearing and vanishing without a trace.\n\nOne day, Wang Qiwu arrived at a small town where he heard that a martial arts master lived nearby who might have some information. He found the master's residence, only to discover it had been abandoned. 'One step too late,' Wang Qiwu thought to himself.\n\nJust then, he heard footsteps behind him. Turning around, he saw several men in black approaching. Their eyes were cold and sharp, and their bodies radiated killing intent.\n\n'Found you, kid,' one of the men said coldly. 'Didn't expect you to be so lucky -- managing to escape alive.'\n\n'It's you! You're the ones who destroyed the Green Bamboo Gang!' Wang Qiwu's eyes turned red. 'I will avenge everyone in the Green Bamboo Gang!'\n\n'Avenge?' the man in black sneered. 'With what? Kid, you're too naive. In this martial world, the strong prey on the weak -- that's the iron law. Your Green Bamboo Gang was too weak. Being wiped out was what you deserved.'\n\n'You!' Wang Qiwu trembled with rage, but he knew this was not the time for recklessness. Against so many masters, he stood no chance of winning.\n\nSeveral men in black attacked simultaneously, converging on Wang Qiwu. Though his martial arts were respectable, facing this many experts, he quickly found himself on the losing side. He fought with everything he had and finally found an opening to turn and flee.\n\n'After him!' the leader barked, and the men in black gave chase.\n\nWang Qiwu knew the terrain well and soon managed to shake them off. He hid in a cave, gasping for breath. He knew his current strength was far from sufficient. To get his revenge, he had to become much stronger.\n\nFrom that day forward, Wang Qiwu threw himself into even more rigorous training. He rose before dawn every day and trained until deep into the night. Though it was exhausting, he never once gave up. At the same time, he continued searching for the whereabouts of the men in black.\n\nOne day, Wang Qiwu heard about a martial arts convention nearby where many martial arts masters would gather. He thought this would be a good opportunity -- perhaps he could learn something there.\n\nWang Qiwu arrived at the convention to find a sea of people, martial artists of every stripe gathered together. He asked around and finally obtained some leads from a veteran of the martial world. 'Those men in black?' the old veteran pondered. 'I think I've heard of them. They seem to belong to an organization called the \"Shadow Gate\" -- they specialize in taking on shady jobs.'\n\n'Shadow Gate?' Wang Qiwu's interest was piqued. 'Do you know where they are?'\n\n'That, I don't know,' the old veteran shook his head. 'The Shadow Gate is very secretive -- very few people know their actual location. However, I've heard their sect master is a formidable figure whose martial arts are unfathomably deep.'\n\n'Thank you,' Wang Qiwu said. 'I will find them.'\n\nThe Shadow Gate's pursuit grew more relentless, and Wang Qiwu found himself fleeing almost daily. One day, he took shelter in an abandoned temple and was just about to rest when he suddenly heard footsteps outside.\n\n'Come out, kid. We know you're in there,' an icy voice called from outside.\n\nWang Qiwu stepped out of the temple to find over a dozen men in black standing outside, all of them experts. 'Attack!' the leader ordered, and over a dozen assassins struck simultaneously.\n\nWang Qiwu fought back with everything he had, but was quickly overwhelmed and badly wounded. It seemed he couldn't hold on much longer. 'Am I really going to die here today?' Wang Qiwu thought in despair.\n\nJust then, a long, piercing whistle sounded from the distance. An instant later, a white-haired old man came hurtling in like a bolt of lightning, instantly striking down several of the men in black.\n\n'When I see injustice on the road, I draw my blade to help,' the old man said calmly. 'You of the Shadow Gate have committed too many evils. Today, I shall carry out heaven's justice and put an end to you.'\n\nIn less time than it takes to burn a stick of incense, all the men in black had been defeated by the old man. The leader, seeing the situation was hopeless, tried to flee but was killed by a single palm strike from the old man.\n\n'Thank you, elder, for saving my life,' Wang Qiwu struggled to his feet and bowed to the old man.\n\n'No need to thank me,' the old man waved his hand. 'I can see you have potential, and I didn't want to see you die like this. However, your current strength is still far too weak. If you want revenge, you have a long way to go. I can give you some guidance.'\n\nFrom that day on, Wang Qiwu studied martial arts under the old man. The old man taught him advanced techniques that were very difficult, but Wang Qiwu studied earnestly. Unfortunately, the good times didn't last long. The Shadow Gate soon tracked them down, and even the sect master himself came in person.\n\n'Kid, run -- now. Leave this to me. Remember: survive, grow stronger, and then come back for your revenge!'\n\nWang Qiwu gritted his teeth and turned to run. Behind him came the sounds of fierce combat. He knew the old man's chances were grim. But he couldn't give up -- he had to survive, had to grow stronger, had to have his revenge!"

        "title": "The Ultimate Martial Art",
        "content": "Wang Qiwu pressed on through his despair, not knowing where to go or what to do. He could only wander aimlessly, hoping to find some glimmer of hope.\n\nOne day, Wang Qiwu came upon a desolate valley. It was completely uninhabited, overgrown with weeds and scattered with loose rocks. Exhausted and starving, Wang Qiwu found a cave to rest in.\n\nJust as he was about to start a fire, he suddenly noticed something glowing deep within the cave. Curious, he walked over to investigate and found strange characters and diagrams carved into the stone wall. These writings and illustrations appeared to be extremely ancient, as if they had existed for a very, very long time.\n\n'What is this?' Wang Qiwu examined them carefully and realized the characters and diagrams appeared to be some kind of martial arts manual. Though he hadn't had much formal education, he had studied martial arts under Old Man Wang since childhood and had some understanding of martial arts manuals.\n\nHe studied the characters and diagrams closely and discovered this was an extremely advanced martial art. The training method was very peculiar -- it required directing one's internal energy along specific pathways within the body, then transforming it into immense power.\n\n'Could this be the legendary ultimate martial art?' Wang Qiwu thought excitedly. Reading further, he discovered it was a technique called 'Primordial Energy.' This martial art was extraordinary -- it could transform one's internal energy into tremendous power of limitless might. It was said that at the highest level of mastery, one could split mountains and shatter boulders, its power without equal.\n\nWang Qiwu felt as if he had found a priceless treasure and immediately began training. Though the technique was difficult, he studied with utmost dedication. Every day, aside from eating and sleeping, he did nothing but practice, almost to the point of forgetting food and rest. He followed the method inscribed on the stone wall, practicing over and over again. Though it was grueling, he never once gave up.\n\nAfter one month, Wang Qiwu had finally mastered the fundamentals of Primordial Energy. He could feel that his strength had undergone a qualitative leap -- his internal energy was now several times more powerful than before. He tried channeling Primordial Energy and struck out with his palm. With a thunderous boom, his palm left a deep imprint in the cave wall.\n\n'Excellent!' Wang Qiwu thought with excitement. 'With this technique, I can finally have my revenge!'\n\nBut Wang Qiwu knew that martial arts alone weren't enough. He needed combat experience -- he needed to test his strength against real opponents.\n\nOne day, Wang Qiwu left the valley, intending to seek out the Shadow Gate and test his abilities. But just as he exited the valley, he ran into a group of bandits.\n\n'Hand over all your money, kid!' one bandit snarled viciously.\n\n'I have no money,' Wang Qiwu said calmly.\n\n'No money?' the bandit sneered. 'Then leave your life behind!'\n\nWith that, several bandits attacked Wang Qiwu simultaneously. Wang Qiwu remained composed, channeled his Primordial Energy, and struck out with his palm. With a resounding boom, the bandits were sent flying by a single blow, crashing heavily to the ground, unable to get back up.\n\n'How... how is this possible?' one bandit said in terror. 'How can your martial arts be so powerful?'\n\n'Scared now?' Wang Qiwu said coldly. 'Too late.'\n\nWang Qiwu didn't kill the bandits -- he merely crippled their martial arts, then left. He knew he now had the ability to seek out the Shadow Gate for his revenge.\n\nBut what Wang Qiwu didn't know was that word of his training in Primordial Energy had already reached some people in the martial world. These people coveted the Primordial Energy technique and came in droves to seize it. One day, while Wang Qiwu was resting at an inn, he suddenly heard a commotion outside.\n\nHe stepped out to find a crowd of martial artists gathered at the inn's entrance, apparently waiting for someone. 'Wang Qiwu, you've finally appeared,' said a man who seemed to be their leader. 'Hand over the Primordial Energy manual, and we might consider leaving your corpse intact.'\n\n'Primordial Energy?' Wang Qiwu was startled. 'How do you know about that?'\n\n'That's none of your concern,' the leader said. 'All you need to know is that today, you must hand over the manual.'\n\n'I don't have a manual,' Wang Qiwu said. 'I read it off a stone wall. It's all in my head.'\n\n'Then hand over your head!' the leader roared. 'Attack!'\n\nA mob of martial artists attacked Wang Qiwu all at once. Wang Qiwu channeled his Primordial Energy and engaged them in fierce combat. Though none of these fighters were weak, Wang Qiwu's Primordial Energy was superior. Each palm strike carried immense internal force, driving them back step by step.\n\n'How... how is this possible?' the leader said in horror. 'How can your martial arts be so powerful?'\n\n'This is the might of Primordial Energy,' Wang Qiwu said calmly. 'Now it's your turn.'\n\nWang Qiwu showed no mercy and struck them all to the ground. He knew that in this martial world, showing mercy to enemies was showing cruelty to oneself. 'Now, tell me -- how did you learn about Primordial Energy?' Wang Qiwu asked coldly.\n\n'It... it was the Shadow Gate people who told us,' the leader stammered in fear. 'They said if we could kill you and obtain the Primordial Energy manual, they would pay us a fortune.'\n\n'Shadow Gate?' A flash of murderous intent crossed Wang Qiwu's eyes. 'They truly are relentless. Well then -- it's high time I settled accounts with them.'"

        "content": "Wang Qiwu decided to take the fight to the enemy and go after the Shadow Gate for his revenge. He learned that the Shadow Gate's headquarters was at a place called Black Wind Mountain and set off immediately.\n\nAfter several days of arduous travel, Wang Qiwu finally arrived at Black Wind Mountain. The terrain was treacherous and easily defensible -- indeed an ideal location for establishing a sect. Black Wind Mountain soared into the clouds, its peaks shrouded in mist, giving off an aura that was both mysterious and dangerous.\n\n'Shadow Gate, here I come,' Wang Qiwu gazed at the mountain gate before him, his eyes burning with hatred. 'Today, I will avenge everyone in the Green Bamboo Gang!'\n\nHe channeled his Primordial Energy and struck the gate with his palm. With a tremendous boom, the gate was shattered by a single blow, sending stone fragments flying in all directions.\n\n'Who goes there?' The Shadow Gate disciples heard the commotion and rushed out. Every one of them was a skilled fighter with cold, sharp eyes radiating killing intent.\n\n'Wang Qiwu,' he said coldly. 'I'm here for revenge.'\n\n'You?' one disciple recognized Wang Qiwu. 'You actually dare show your face here? You must have a death wish!'\n\n'Enough talk!' Wang Qiwu roared. 'Bring out your sect master!'\n\n'You want to see the sect master?' the disciple sneered. 'First you'll have to get through us!'\n\nA group of Shadow Gate disciples attacked Wang Qiwu simultaneously. Wang Qiwu channeled his Primordial Energy and engaged them in fierce combat. Though these disciples were no weaklings, Wang Qiwu's Primordial Energy proved superior. Each palm strike carried tremendous internal force, driving them steadily backward.\n\n'How... how is this possible?' one disciple said in terror. 'How can your martial arts be so powerful?'\n\n'This is the might of Primordial Energy,' Wang Qiwu said calmly. 'Now it's your turn.'\n\nWang Qiwu showed no mercy, striking them all to the ground. He knew that every one of these people had been involved in the massacre of the Green Bamboo Gang -- he couldn't afford to be soft-hearted.\n\n'Sect master, come out!' Wang Qiwu shouted. 'Today, I challenge you to a fight to the death!'\n\n'What bold words,' an icy voice came from within. 'Kid, you've certainly grown stronger, but you're still not there yet.'\n\nThe Shadow Gate sect master emerged. His gaze was cold and sharp, and his body radiated a powerful killing intent. Wang Qiwu knew this was a truly formidable enemy. The sect master appeared to be in his forties, tall and imposing, with eyes like a hawk's -- clearly a battle-hardened veteran.\n\n'So you're the Shadow Gate sect master?' Wang Qiwu said coldly. 'You're the one who ordered the destruction of the Green Bamboo Gang?'\n\n'That's right,' the sect master nodded. 'It was my order. But I'm curious -- how did you survive?'\n\n'That's none of your concern,' Wang Qiwu said. 'Today, I will avenge everyone in the Green Bamboo Gang!'\n\n'Avenge?' the sect master sneered. 'With what? Kid, you're too naive. In this martial world, the strong prey on the weak -- that's the iron law. Your Green Bamboo Gang was too weak. Being wiped out was what you deserved.'\n\n'You!' Wang Qiwu trembled with fury, but he knew this was not the time for recklessness. He had to stay calm to defeat this formidable enemy.\n\n'Come then,' the sect master said casually. 'Show me just how strong your Primordial Energy really is.'\n\nWang Qiwu channeled his Primordial Energy and struck at the sect master. The sect master calmly channeled his own technique and met Wang Qiwu's palm with his own. With a thunderous boom, both men were pushed back several steps. Wang Qiwu felt his entire arm go numb and thought in alarm, 'What incredible martial arts!'\n\n'Not bad,' the sect master nodded. 'Your Primordial Energy is interesting. But it's not enough.'\n\nWith that, the sect master launched his attack. His martial arts were terrifyingly advanced -- every move put Wang Qiwu in mortal danger. Though Wang Qiwu fought with everything he had, he quickly found himself losing ground.\n\n'No good -- his martial arts are too strong,' Wang Qiwu thought. 'I'm no match for him at all.'\n\nBut Wang Qiwu didn't give up. He gritted his teeth and kept fighting. He knew that if he couldn't get his revenge today, he might never get another chance.\n\nThe two fought for hundreds of exchanges. Despite giving everything he had, Wang Qiwu was struck in the chest by the sect master's palm and sent crashing to the ground. Wang Qiwu coughed up a mouthful of blood, feeling as though all his organs had been displaced.\n\n'Kid, you've lost,' the sect master said coldly. 'Your Primordial Energy is decent, but still far from enough. Now you can die.'\n\nThe sect master raised his palm to strike Wang Qiwu's head. Wang Qiwu tried to dodge, but it was too late.\n\nAt that critical moment, a long, piercing whistle suddenly sounded from the distance. An instant later, a figure came hurtling in like lightning, positioning himself between Wang Qiwu and the sect master.\n\n'Who are you?' the sect master cried in alarm.\n\n'It's me,' came a familiar voice. 'Old villain, we meet again.'\n\nWang Qiwu looked up and saw the old man who had saved him before standing in front of him. Though the old man appeared to have been seriously wounded, his gaze was still sharp.\n\n'Elder, you...' Wang Qiwu said with emotion.\n\n'Don't speak,' the old man said. 'Go, quickly. Leave this to me.'\n\n'No, I can't abandon you!' Wang Qiwu protested.\n\n'Go!' the old man roared. 'Staying here will only get you killed. Remember -- survive, and one day you will become strong enough!'\n\nWang Qiwu gritted his teeth, knowing the old man was right. Staying would only be a burden. Only by surviving would there be hope of revenge.\n\n'Elder, take care!' Wang Qiwu said, then struggled to his feet and ran.\n\nBehind him came the sounds of fierce combat, but Wang Qiwu didn't dare look back. He could only run with all his might, not daring to stop until he had gone very, very far.\n\n'Elder...' Wang Qiwu collapsed to his knees, tears streaming down his face. He knew the old man's chances were grim.\n\n'Why? Why am I always so weak?' Wang Qiwu clenched his fists. 'Why can't I protect anyone? Why can't I get my revenge?'\n\nWang Qiwu sank into deep despair. He felt like a worthless failure -- unable to do anything, only able to watch helplessly as the people around him died one by one. But he couldn't give up. He had to survive, had to grow stronger, had to have his revenge!"

        "content": "After his defeat, Wang Qiwu resumed his life on the run. He knew the Shadow Gate wouldn't let him go -- he had to hide and bide his time.\n\nOne day, Wang Qiwu arrived at a small town. It was remote and little known. He decided to settle here temporarily and wait for things to blow over. Though the town was small, it was lively -- the streets bustled with people coming and going, and the calls of various vendors rose and fell.\n\nBut Wang Qiwu had no money and needed to find a way to feed himself. He searched everywhere for work, but nobody was willing to hire a stranger of unknown origins. Just as Wang Qiwu was on the verge of giving up hope, he noticed a small stall on the street selling beef offal. The vendor was an old man who looked kind-hearted, his face always wearing a smile.\n\n'Would you like some beef offal, young man?' the old man asked with a smile.\n\n'I... I have no money,' Wang Qiwu said with a bitter smile. 'But I can work for you -- all I need is a meal.'\n\n'Work for me?' the old man thought it over. 'What can you do?'\n\n'I... I know martial arts,' Wang Qiwu said. 'I can protect your stall and make sure nobody causes trouble.'\n\n'Martial arts?' the old man chuckled. 'Young man, this is a small town, not the martial world. It's very peaceful here -- we don't need martial arts. But if you're willing, you can help me cut beef offal.'\n\n'Cut beef offal?' Wang Qiwu was taken aback. 'That... I can do.'\n\n'Then give it a try,' the old man said.\n\nWang Qiwu picked up a knife and began cutting beef offal. Though he had never done this kind of work before, his martial arts gave him steady hands, and his cuts were surprisingly skillful. Every slice was precise, producing pieces of uniform size that looked remarkably professional.\n\n'Not bad,' the old man nodded approvingly. 'You cut very well. From now on, you can help me cut beef offal. I'll pay you ten copper coins a day, plus one meal.'\n\n'Thank you!' Wang Qiwu said gratefully.\n\nFrom that day on, Wang Qiwu worked at the old man's stall. Every day he cut beef offal, served customers, and though it was tiring, it was fulfilling. Gradually, Wang Qiwu discovered that this ordinary life was actually quite nice. Without the thrills of the martial world, there was also none of its danger. He could live in peace without worrying about being hunted.\n\n'Young man, you don't seem like an ordinary person,' the old man said to Wang Qiwu one day. 'You carry a killing edge about you -- you must come from the martial world, am I right?'\n\n'How... how did you know?' Wang Qiwu asked in surprise.\n\n'I may be a beef offal vendor, but I spent a few years in the martial world myself,' the old man said with a smile. 'That edge you carry -- I spotted it the moment I saw you. But since you've chosen this place, live well. Let the matters of the martial world stay in the past.'\n\n'The past?' Wang Qiwu said with a bitter smile. 'I'd like to put it behind me, but there are things I haven't finished.'\n\n'What things?' the old man asked.\n\n'Revenge,' Wang Qiwu said. 'My family and friends were all killed. I must avenge them.'\n\n'Revenge?' the old man shook his head. 'Young man, revenge is easy to talk about but hard to carry out. And even if you succeed, what then? Will your family and friends come back to life?'\n\n'I know,' Wang Qiwu said. 'But I have to do it. It's a promise I made to them.'\n\n'A promise?' the old man smiled. 'Young man, you're still young -- there's much you don't understand. In this world, some things are fated, and you can't change them. Rather than clinging to revenge, it would be better to live well and let the departed rest in peace.'\n\n'Let the departed rest in peace?' Wang Qiwu fell into deep thought.\n\n'Yes,' the old man said. 'I believe your family and friends wouldn't want to see you suffer your whole life for the sake of revenge. They would want you to live well, to be happy and at peace.'\n\nWang Qiwu listened to the old man's words, his emotions in turmoil. He knew the old man was right. But he still couldn't let go of his desire for vengeance.\n\n'Let me think about it,' Wang Qiwu said.\n\nThree years later, Wang Qiwu left the small town. During those three years, he had traveled the length and breadth of the martial world, surviving countless life-and-death trials. He had become stronger and more mature. But most importantly, he had finally come to understand the old man's words. Revenge couldn't bring the dead back to life; clinging to hatred would only bring a lifetime of suffering.\n\nWang Qiwu returned to the small town and found the beef offal vendor. 'Old man, I'm back. I want to sell beef offal with you.'\n\n'Sell beef offal? Young man, are you sure about this? Selling beef offal isn't exactly a great job -- it's tiring and doesn't pay much.'\n\n'I'm sure,' Wang Qiwu said. 'I've realized that this ordinary life is actually quite good. Without the thrills of the martial world, there's also none of its danger. I can live in peace without worrying about being hunted.'\n\n'Good,' the old man nodded. 'Since you've made up your mind, then stay. But remember -- though selling beef offal is humble work, you must take it seriously. Every serving of beef offal should be made with care.'\n\nFrom that day on, Wang Qiwu worked at the old man's stall. Every day he cut beef offal, served customers, and though it was tiring, it was fulfilling. Gradually, Wang Qiwu discovered that this ordinary life was indeed quite nice. He could chat with customers and listen to their interesting stories. He could live in peace without worrying about being hunted.\n\n'Young man, your cuts are really excellent,' a customer praised. 'I've never had such delicious beef offal.'\n\n'Thank you,' Wang Qiwu said with a smile. 'The credit goes to the old man. I just help out.'\n\n'No, you cut very well,' the old man said. 'Your hands are steady, and every slice is precise. That's not something just anyone can do.'\n\n'That's... that's because I used to practice martial arts,' Wang Qiwu said. 'Martial arts demand precision and stability, so my hands are steadier than most.'\n\nSeveral years later, the old man, due to his advancing age, handed the stall over to Wang Qiwu. After taking over, Wang Qiwu made the business even more prosperous. He didn't just sell beef offal -- he began selling other street foods as well. Gradually, his stall became the most popular food stand in the whole town.\n\n'Because this is the life I've chosen. It may be ordinary, but it makes me happy. This is the life I want.' Wang Qiwu looked at the bustling crowd of customers before him, his heart filled with contentment. He knew this was the life he wanted. It may have been ordinary, but it made him happy."

        "content": "One day, while Wang Qiwu was busy at his stall, he suddenly caught sight of a familiar figure. It was a young woman. Though simply dressed, she carried herself with an extraordinary grace that made her stand out in the crowd.\n\n'Qiwu? Is that really you?' the woman walked up to the stall, her eyes sparkling with delight.\n\n'Xiao... Xiaoyue?' Wang Qiwu was stunned. This was his childhood companion, and the girl he had once secretly loved. Xiaoyue was from a village near the Green Bamboo Gang. They had played together often as children, and Wang Qiwu had harbored a secret crush on her.\n\n'What are you doing here? I heard that the Green Bamboo Gang...' Xiaoyue stopped mid-sentence. She looked at Wang Qiwu, a flash of heartache in her eyes.\n\n'It's all in the past,' Wang Qiwu said with a bitter smile. 'Now I'm just a beef offal vendor.'\n\n'A beef offal vendor?' Xiaoyue looked at the stall. 'That... doesn't sound like you at all. Didn't you used to say you were going to roam the martial world and become a great hero?'\n\n'That was then, this is now,' Wang Qiwu said. 'Perhaps this ordinary life suits me better.'\n\nXiaoyue was quiet for a moment, then said, 'Actually, I've opened a small shop nearby. If you're free, come visit me sometime.'\n\n'I will,' Wang Qiwu nodded.\n\nWatching Xiaoyue walk away, Wang Qiwu's emotions were a tangled mess. Perhaps this was fate's design. He had once dreamed of being with Xiaoyue, but now he was just a beef offal vendor, and Xiaoyue had her own life.\n\nThe peaceful days didn't last long before the Shadow Gate's men found him again. One day, several men in black appeared in the small town, asking around for Wang Qiwu's whereabouts. These men all had cold, sharp eyes and radiated killing intent -- clearly not people to be trifled with.\n\n'I hear there's a beef offal vendor here with impressive martial arts?' one of the men in black asked a local resident.\n\n'Oh yes, that young man is quite skilled,' a resident said. 'He has very steady hands -- cuts beef offal beautifully.'\n\nWhen Wang Qiwu heard the news, his heart sank. He knew he couldn't stay here any longer, or the townspeople would be endangered. These men in black were ruthless killers. If they learned the townspeople had helped him, they would surely retaliate.\n\n'Old man, I have to leave,' Wang Qiwu told the old vendor. 'The Shadow Gate has found me. I can't put you and the townspeople in danger.'\n\n'Where will you go?' the old man asked.\n\n'I don't know,' Wang Qiwu shook his head. 'But I'll come back. Once I've resolved this, I'll come back.'\n\n'Very well,' the old man nodded. 'Remember -- wherever you go, stay alive.'\n\nWang Qiwu packed his things, ready to leave. But just then, a thought struck him -- perhaps he should take the fight to them instead of running forever. He had been running for too long. It was time to face this head-on.\n\n'No, I can't leave,' Wang Qiwu said suddenly. 'I'm going to stay and put an end to this.'\n\n'Are you sure?' the old man asked.\n\n'I'm sure,' Wang Qiwu said with resolve. 'I've been running for too long. It's time to face this. I can't let these villains continue to harm innocent people.'\n\nWang Qiwu decided to take the offensive. He found the men in black and directly revealed his identity. 'I am Wang Qiwu. The one you're looking for.'\n\n'Very good,' the leader of the men in black sneered. 'Since you've come to us willingly, don't blame us for showing no mercy.'\n\n'Come then,' Wang Qiwu channeled his Primordial Energy, ready for battle.\n\nThis time, Wang Qiwu didn't run. He fought with everything he had, clashing fiercely with the men in black. Though they outnumbered him, Wang Qiwu's Primordial Energy had reached heights far beyond what it once was. Every palm strike carried tremendous internal force, driving the men in black steadily backward.\n\nAfter an intense battle, Wang Qiwu finally defeated them all. But he knew this was only the beginning. The Shadow Gate wouldn't let it rest -- they would send even more men. 'It seems I have to resolve this once and for all,' Wang Qiwu thought. He decided to head to Black Wind Mountain once more and settle things with the Shadow Gate sect master for good. This time, he would not run."

        "content": "Wang Qiwu arrived at Black Wind Mountain again, but this time he found that the Shadow Gate had been abandoned. The entire mountain was deathly silent -- not even the sound of birdsong could be heard, giving the place an eerie, lifeless feeling.\n\n'What happened here?' Wang Qiwu wondered. He cautiously entered the Shadow Gate's headquarters and found it completely empty -- not a soul in sight. But a faint smell of blood still lingered in the air, suggesting a battle had taken place here not long ago.\n\nHe searched throughout the headquarters and finally discovered some clues in a hidden chamber. Inside the chamber was a table, and on the table lay a worn and tattered book. Wang Qiwu opened the book and found that it recorded a legend concerning a secret of the martial world.\n\nAs it turned out, the Shadow Gate had destroyed the Green Bamboo Gang because the gang had inadvertently stumbled upon an important secret. This secret concerned the safety of the entire martial world. It was said that whoever possessed this secret could obtain supreme power. The Shadow Gate had wiped out the entire Green Bamboo Gang to seize it.\n\n'So that's what it was,' Wang Qiwu finally understood the truth behind everything. He clenched his fists, his eyes blazing with fury. That the Shadow Gate had annihilated the entire Green Bamboo Gang over some elusive secret was something he could not accept.\n\nBut at that moment, he suddenly heard footsteps outside. Turning around, he saw the Shadow Gate sect master enter with a group of followers. The sect master looked even more sinister than before, his eyes filled with murderous intent.\n\n'Kid, you've finally come,' the sect master said coldly. 'We've been waiting for you for a long time.'\n\n'Why did you destroy the Green Bamboo Gang?' Wang Qiwu demanded.\n\n'Because your Green Bamboo Gang learned a secret it shouldn't have,' the sect master said. 'Now it's your turn.'\n\n'A secret?' Wang Qiwu scoffed. 'You wiped out the entire Green Bamboo Gang over some elusive secret?'\n\n'In this martial world, the strong prey on the weak -- that's the iron law,' the sect master said. 'Your Green Bamboo Gang was too weak. Being wiped out was what you deserved.'\n\n'You!' Wang Qiwu trembled with rage, but he knew this was not the time for recklessness. He had to stay calm to defeat this formidable enemy.\n\nWang Qiwu and the Shadow Gate sect master faced off once more. This time, Wang Qiwu's Primordial Energy had reached full maturity, and his strength was incomparably greater than before. He could feel that his internal energy was now several times more powerful, each palm strike carrying tremendous force.\n\nThe two fought for hundreds of exchanges, locked in a struggle where neither could gain a clear advantage. Though Wang Qiwu gave everything he had, he gradually began to lose ground. The sect master's martial arts were terrifyingly advanced -- every move put Wang Qiwu in mortal danger.\n\n'No, I cannot lose,' Wang Qiwu thought. 'I must avenge everyone in the Green Bamboo Gang! I cannot let their blood be shed in vain!'\n\nAt that moment, he suddenly recalled the final technique the old man had taught him. This move carried devastating power, but it would also consume every last drop of his internal energy. If he used it, he might die -- but he could no longer afford to hold back.\n\n'All or nothing!' Wang Qiwu gritted his teeth, summoned every ounce of internal energy in his body, and unleashed the final technique. He felt his energy surge forth like a tidal wave, concentrating in his palm and forming an immense force.\n\nWith a tremendous boom, the Shadow Gate sect master was struck squarely by Wang Qiwu's palm and sent crashing to the ground, unable to rise again. Blood sprayed from the sect master's mouth, his eyes filled with defiance and rage.\n\n'I... I've lost,' the sect master said with difficulty. 'But... you won't live much longer either. That move will have drained all your energy...'\n\n'I know,' Wang Qiwu said. 'But I've fulfilled my mission. I've avenged everyone in the Green Bamboo Gang. That's enough.'\n\nThough Wang Qiwu had defeated the Shadow Gate sect master, the extreme expenditure had left him gravely injured. He could feel that his internal energy was completely spent, his body so weak he could barely stand. He dragged his exhausted body away from Black Wind Mountain, one step at a time.\n\nAfter several days of arduous travel, Wang Qiwu finally returned to the small town. 'Qiwu, you're back!' the old man said, overjoyed at the sight of him. 'Are you alright?'\n\n'I'm fine,' Wang Qiwu said with a weary smile. 'It's all over now.'\n\n'Over?' the old man asked.\n\n'Yes,' Wang Qiwu nodded. 'The Shadow Gate no longer exists. I... I've fulfilled my mission.'\n\n'That's good,' the old man said. 'Now you can live in peace.'\n\n'Yes,' Wang Qiwu said. 'I want to keep selling beef offal with you. This ordinary life -- it's actually quite good.'\n\n'Good,' the old man said with a smile. 'Welcome back.'\n\nFrom that day on, Wang Qiwu returned to the stall. Every day he cut beef offal, served customers, and lived an ordinary but fulfilling life. Though he was no longer the little rascal, nor the avenger he had been, he had found the life he truly wanted.\n\nThis is the story of \"The Legend of Qiwu's Martial Demon.\" A story about growing up, seeking revenge, and ultimately finding oneself. From reckless troublemaker to vengeful warrior, and finally to a man who discovered the beauty in an ordinary life -- Wang Qiwu had been through so much. But in the end, he understood that true happiness doesn't lie in how powerful your martial arts are, or how high your status in the martial world is, but in being able to live the life you truly want."
